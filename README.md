# What Neighborhood Am I In?

I built this little app using PHP and the Google Maps API to determine what neighborhood you're in.

## How To Use It ##

Get an API key from the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), and enter it where it says [YOUR API KEY].

When you visit the page, it will display the neighborhood you're currently in. That's it!
